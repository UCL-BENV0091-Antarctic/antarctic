BENV0091 Group Project for predicting Arctic Sea Ice by Supervised Learning

## R environment
We are heavily using [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) as our developing platform to implement, build, and test our SL models for environmental risks on Arctic sea ice, and using [**miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create isolated environments and manage our R packages.

For new/existing users of miniconda/Anaconda, please go to [Create R environment in miniconda](https://github.com/realgjl/r_basic/blob/master/README.md#create-r-environment-in-miniconda) or [For existing conda users: create a new and isolated R environment](https://github.com/realgjl/r_basic/blob/master/README.md#for-existing-conda-users-create-a-new-and-isolated-r-environment).

## Necessary libraries
tidyverse corrplot MASS randomforest neuralnet
```terminal
conda install -c conda-forge r-tidyverse r-corrplot r-mass r-randomforest r-neuralnet
```
