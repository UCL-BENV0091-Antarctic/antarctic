We are heavily using [**Jupyter Notebook/Lab**](https://jupyter.org/) as our developing platform to implement, build, and test our models for , and using [**miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create isolated environments and manage our R packages.

## Jupyter & conda
### How to use Jupyter Notebook for R
Open terminal & activate your R environment:
```terminal
conda activate r_env
```
Open Jupyter Notebook:
```terminal
jupyter notebook
```
Open Jupyter Lab:
```terminal
jupyter lab
```
Create a **New** Jupyter Notbook using **R**, or **uploading** an existing **ipynb** file from your Mac, or move to specific items to perform actions.

Exit the current Jupyter environment: press ```control``` ```c``` at terminal

### How to install new packages for R
Open terminal & activate your R environment:
```terminal
conda activate r_env

For popular packages, I suggest installing packages from two more suitable package owners: **r** and **conda-forge**:
